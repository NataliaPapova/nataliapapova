### Hi there!

I'm Natalia from Belarus. I want to change my field of work and become a QA engineer. I have completed Introduction to Software Testing courses at EPAM Systems Inc. and Software Testing at Stormnet Technologies LLC. I have a degree in economics and experience in the banking sector as a specialist in cash management as well as corporate lending. At the moment I am working as a chief accountant and am looking to upgrade my skills.
